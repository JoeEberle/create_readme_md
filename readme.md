The README.md file is a common practice in software development projects, serving as a user-friendly introduction and guide to the project. Typically written in Markdown format for easy formatting and readability, this file provides essential information about the project, such as its purpose, features, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution guidelines. The README.md file acts as a central hub for stakeholders, including developers, collaborators, and users, to quickly understand the project's goals, functionalities, and how to interact with it effectively. Its primary purpose is to facilitate communication and collaboration, ensuring that everyone involved in the project has access to relevant information and resources to contribute effectively and utilize the project to its fullest potential.
